    "The gene that we will try to investiage would be the CDH1 gene, which encodes for E-adherin that maintains cell adhesion. With the loss of CDH1 cell adhesion is disrupted and it allows tumor cells to detach and migrate. \n",

    "*Will you be focusing on a single cancer type or looking across cancer types? Depending on your decision, update this section to include relevant information about the disease at the appropriate level of detail. Regardless, each bullet point should be filled in. If you are looking at multiple cancer types, you should investigate differences between the types (e.g. what is the most prevalent cancer type? What type has the highest mortality rate?) and similarities (e.g. what sorts of treatments exist across the board for cancer patients? what is common to all cancers in terms of biological mechanisms?). Note that this is a smaller list than the initial 11 in Module 1.*\n",

The most prevalent cancer type that we have chosen is breast cancer for females and prostate cancer for males. In 2025, the incidence for all cancer is about 2,041,910 new cancer cases.

The key mechanism in cancer development include the genetic mutation that disrupts the normal cellular function. These mutation leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Additionally, cancer cells are able to negate the normal signalling pathways and promote their own growth and survival. "
